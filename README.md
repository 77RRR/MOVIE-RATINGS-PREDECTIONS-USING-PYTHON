Movie Ratings Prediction

 Overview
This project aims to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. It applies regression techniques to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates user or critic ratings.

 Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about movies, including:
- Movie Title
- Genre
- Director
- Lead Actors
- Release Year
- Budget
- Box Office Revenue
- User Reviews
- Critic Reviews
- IMDB/Rotten Tomatoes Ratings (Target Variable)

The dataset can be obtained from sources like [Kaggle Movie Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com) or other movie databases.

 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory

 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading: Import the movie dataset.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze data distributions and correlations.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Select and transform relevant features for model training.
5. Model Selection & Training: Train different regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score.
7. Predictions & Deployment (Optional): Use the trained model to predict ratings for new movies.

 How to Run the Project
 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

 Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-ratings-prediction.git
   cd movie-ratings-prediction
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Load the dataset and run the notebook cells sequentially.
4. Train and evaluate the model.
5. Modify parameters and compare model performance.

 Results & Findings
- Genre and director significantly impact movie ratings.
- Higher-budget movies often have better ratings, but not always.
- User reviews and critic scores are strong predictors of movie ratings.
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting performed best among tested models.

 Future Improvements
- Tune hyperparameters for better model accuracy.
- Experiment with deep learning techniques (e.g., Neural Networks).
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
